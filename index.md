# Welcome to the Challenge Documentation

Even a simple idea of modifying blocks on existing tracks may require longer explanations. Challenge is much bigger than it may seem like.

Learn further functionality, techniques, concept of modifying and how to use Challenge API here.

Where to start? You can look at [Modifier](#/modifier) to see how modifications work. Or you can look further into [Understanding Modification Scripts](#/understanding-modification-scripts).
