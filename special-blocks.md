Special block is a Challenge API technology which defines multiple standard blocks as one block. Special block is basically made with 1-3 macroblocks, depending on the amount of block variants you want to have.

Special blocks were invented to make the missing opposite waypoints possible, but its usage can be used in many other ways. Using them optimizes modifier code and improves clarity.
